# sql-challenge
Hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. My first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. I will be designing tables to hold data from six CSV files that remain of the employee database from that period.


# Going about the Challenge
This challenge was approached via 3 steps. First, I began with Data Modeling. Usisng QuickDBD, I prepared a sketch diagram of the tables and their relationships with each other. Then, I did some Data Engineering. Six tables were prepared in PGAdmin using CREATE TABLE and data was importing into the appropriate tables from the six CSV files. Lastly, I concluded with an analysis of the data. By manipulating the data, I managed to present tables that answered the eight questions this challenge wanted to gather from the CSV files.


# In closing
This week's challenge was extremely fair. It essentially recapped what was learned in class the prior week - assuming I did everything fine enough. I did have troubles importing data into my tables. There were several times I would create a table but the columns would not appear in the schemas. Then, when I would go to import data from the csv files, I would get an error because there were no columns to import to. I'm not sure what the problem or solution was, but after copying and pasting my code into a new query script, everything ran fine.
